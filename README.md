# Environment Setup Filesüíª

This repository contains all the files that I need in order to set up my working environment with [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) and [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)

## Requirements
This setup works under some configuration. Without this configuration there might be things that don't work as expected.

* True color terminal (iTerm2 in my particular case).
* Neovim >= 0.9 (this might change in the future)
* Tmux
* [NerdFont](https://www.nerdfonts.com/).
* [Ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) for Telescope Fuzzy Finder to work.
* XCode Command Lines Tool (macOS).
* Git

## Instalation

In order to have this set up installed and running in your computer, this are the required steps

1. Make sure to have a .config folder in your root directory.
2. Run this command to install the [Tmux plugin manager](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm).
```
git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.tmux/plugins/tpm
```
3. Run this command to clone this repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/ferranpalma/Environment-Setup-Files.git ~/ENV_WD
```

   Note that ENV_WD is the working directory where you want all your environment setup files to live.

4. Create a [soft link](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ln.1.html) for Neovim to find your configuration files.
```
ln -s ~/ENV_WD/.config/nvim/ ~/.config/
```
5. Create a [soft link](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ln.1.html) for tmux to find your configuration file.
```
ln -s ~/ENV_WD/.tmux.conf ~/.tmux.conf
```
6. Install the tmux plugins by creating a session, opening it and using `<Ctrl+a> + I`. Maybe closing the terminal is needed in order for everything to work.

## Tmux üìü

The plugin manager used is [tpm](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm).

Feel free to explore the `.tmux.conf` file to find all the availible commands.

## Neovim ‚å®Ô∏è

The plugin manager used is [Lazy](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim).

The setup also uses [Mason](https://github.com/williamboman/mason.nvim) in combination with [NvimLspConfig](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig) to manage and configure LSP servers.

Each plugin is installed on it's own file. However, some of the most outstanding are:

#### Harpoon
[Harpoon](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/harpoon) is a plugin that allows you to naviagte between a small set of files in a very fast way.

#### Telescope
[Telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) allows to fuzzy find over lists, in other words: it allows you to search anything you can think about. It's absolutely fantastic (and also highly configurable).
Make sure to have installed [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) and to check the gorgeus [telescope documentation](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim#getting-started)

#### UndooTree
[UndooTree](https://github.com/mbbill/undotree) speaks by itself. It allows you to visualize the undo history and work with it. Just use `<leader>ut` and make your life better. Essential plugin.

#### Format on save
[Format on save](https://github.com/elentok/format-on-save.nvim) it's quite self-descriptive. Also essential.
